// This is a small example of a much larger pattern - you call a function on a variable, array, or an object,
// and the function changes the variable or something in the object.

// One of the core principles of functional programming is to not change things. Changes lead to bugs. It's easier to
// prevent bugs knowing that your functions don't change anything, including the function arguments or
// any global variable.
